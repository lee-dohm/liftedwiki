This is [[Lee Dohm|Lee Dohm's]] personal wiki to keep all the crap that won't fit in his head anymore!

At least, that's how this thing started out, an extension for my brain. But it has turned into a legacy project of sorts. Not only the things that I want to remember, but the things that I have experienced, the things that I know or saw that are unique to me. I'm starting this in June of 2012 and we'll see where it goes.
