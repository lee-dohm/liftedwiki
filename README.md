# Lifted Wiki

A personal wiki solution inspired by [Gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum).

I got tired of working with products like OneNote or Evernote because either they had bugs, were not available on my chosen platforms or simply didn't make it very easy to make readable documentation.  Additionally, I see my personal wiki as a kind of documentation for my life.  I want it to be a resource that I use for years and even decades to come.  This means that I need it to be resilient to the failure of businesses and even changing of data formats over the years.  I decided that a personal wiki that I wrote myself would be the best approximation of what I was looking for.

I used Gollum for many months, but it still was not quite what I was looking for either.  Its dependence on Git was both a help and a hindrance.  I synchronized my wiki between my work and home computers via Dropbox and used Git for backup, but they conflicted on occasion making Git time out and preventing me from viewing or saving updates to pages.  Using only Git for synchronization was a pain, so I'm hoping that using only the filesystem and Dropbox (with the occasional manual Git commit and push) will work best.  In addition, I've found the Gollum codebase to be hard to work with given its wide range of capabilities, so I am writing something that is more tailored to my needs.
